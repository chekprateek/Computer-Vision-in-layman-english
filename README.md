# Computer Vision in layman English
This is my attempt to explain popular algorithms in computer vision using simple language. My goal is to deeply understand each algorithm and then break down its logic into easy-to-understand concepts. By doing this, I aim to make the process of programming these algorithms much simpler and more intuitive. This is work under progress!
